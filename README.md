## Website Theme Customization and Default Theme
Website theme customization can only be modified while using the default theme. While the default theme is not available in the theme selector, developers and advanced users can access it by:

1. Opening your browser's developer console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Entering this command: `document.cookie = "theme=default"`
3. Refreshing the page

Once on the default theme, you can use the theme customizer to create your own color scheme.
